                    </div>
                    <p class="fullwithcontenttext">Dental care for our furry friends often goes unnoticed, yet it's a
                        vital
                        aspect of their overall well-being. Can you believe that a recent AAHA study uncovered that
                        approximately two-thirds of pet owners overlook the dental care recommended by veterinarians?
                        And here's
                        the real eye-opener: by the tender age of three, a staggering 80 percent of dogs already display
                        signs
                        of oral issues, according to the American Veterinary Dental Society.<br><br>But dental health
                        isn't just
                        about maintaining pearly whites; it can have far-reaching effects on their overall well-being.
                        Dental
                        issues can lead to more severe health problems like heart, lung, and kidney diseases. It can
                        affect your
                        pet's energy level and life expectancy. That's why it's crucial to kickstart proper dental care
                        early on
                        for your pets.<br><br>While your veterinarian plays a significant role, we pet parents must
                        become
                        involved when it comes to dental care at home. So, let's embark on this dental journey together
                        to
                        ensure our furry pals enjoy the benefits of lifelong dental health and overall
                        happiness.&nbsp;<br><br>Barkle believes that every pet should be registered as a patient in a
                        veterinary
                        practice and have a full exam at least once a year. Yearly examinations are really important for
                        you and
                        your family, as well as your pet. This is the best way to prevent serious problems and expensive
                        procedures. Prevention costs 70% less than active treatment in the long term&nbsp; — this is
                        true in all
                        aspects of health care.</p>

                            periodontal disease, and odor severity is related to the severity of the infection. The

                            with
                            progressive stages. It all begins innocently enough with a bacterial film called plaque,
                            finding
                            a cozy
                            spot on your pet's teeth. As these bacteria solidify into tartar or calculus, they create a
                            rough
                            terrain where more plaque can thrive.<br><br>At this point, it evolves into a more
                            progressed
                            periodontal disease and oral condition that can cause red, swollen gums. But if ignored, it
                            can
                            evolve
                            into gingivitis – picture red, swollen gums that bleed at the slightest touch. But there's
                            more!
                            Plaque
                            and calculus will move below the gum line, leaving no choice but to call in the
                            professionals
                            for a
                            thorough professional cleaning under general anesthesia.<br><br>But here's the good news:
                            with
                            timely
                            action, you can prevent these dental dramas from playing out, that leave you with you no
                            choice
                            but to
                            spend hundreds or more on dental cleanings or procedures like tooth extractions that cause
                            more
                            discomfort for your dog. Instead, start a daily dental routine to keep your furry friend in

                    <p class="p1">We understand that the well-being of your canine companion is your top priority.
                        This is why we want to address a concern that many pet parents share — the use of anesthesia
                        during
                        dental procedures. While anesthesia is a common practice in veterinary dentistry, it's crucial
                        to
                        approach it with care and awareness. Pets with advanced disease would benefit from a
                        professional
                        cleaning prior to using Barkle. This is especially true if loose and abscessed teeth are
                        present. In
                        order to prevent complications from general anesthesia, it is important to prevent gum disease
                        with
                        daily application of Barkle. Similar to your own personal hygiene, daily application is
                        critical, and
                        yearly checkups are important as preventive measures.</p>

                        anesthesia
                        risks. Tailoring the approach to each pet, regular health check-ups, pre-anesthetic exams, and
                        thorough
                        monitoring during the procedure are standard practices to enhance the safety of your
                        dog.<br><br>We
                        encourage open communication with your veterinarian to discuss any concerns or questions you may
                        have
                        about anesthesia. Your active involvement in your pet's healthcare decisions is integral in
